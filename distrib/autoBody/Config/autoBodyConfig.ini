;whether or not you'd like faction bodies to take precedence over race bodies
;default is 1
bFactionGenPriority = 1

;Enable/disable weight biasing of presets.
;default is 0
bEnableWeightBias = 0

;value from -100 to 100 for how much to bias the weight value.
;This adds or subtracts this value from the weight initially generated. 
;So if an actor would have been generated with a simulated weight of 20, a weight bias of 30 will make their weight 50 instead. 
;honestly this feature is kinda stupid and very niche. 
;default is 0
bWeightBiasAmount = 0

;Three options:
;0: Uses actor weights for applying presets
;1: Uses random weights for applying presets 
;2: Uses a specific weight for applying presets
;default is 1
bWeightOptions = 1

;specify what weight (0-100) to use if using option 2 for bWeightOptions
;default is 0
bWeightSpecific = 0

;If this is not set to 0, it will modify the magnitude of the clothing refit. 
;This is a percentage value. So say a particular refit slider is at a value of 50, and this is set to 10, the final clothing modifier will be 5. Set this to 150, and the clothing modifier would be 75. You get the idea. 
;This also works with negative numbers, if you want to invert the sliders for whatever reason.
;default is 0
bRefitFactor = 0

;0 = just standard info
;1 = debug traces. Verbose logging. 
;default is 0
